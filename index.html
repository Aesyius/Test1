    <h2>No one is immune to social engineering. At its core, social engineering exploits human psychology—our natural trust, curiosity, and willingness to help. Whether it's an email, a phone call, or even a face-to-face interaction, attackers know how to manipulate our instincts and emotions to gain access to sensitive information. It's not about being "naive" or "weak"; it's about the way our minds are wired to respond to social cues. We all need to stay vigilant and aware because, in the end, anyone can fall victim to a well-crafted story or a seemingly innocent request. Being cautious and skeptical is not a sign of distrust—it's a sign of awareness and self-protection.</h2>
